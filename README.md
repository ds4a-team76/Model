# Model
Model of the CCN to predict routes

This model was trained on Google Colab, you can check the code of the notebook in this respository


Our idea was to generate images given a trip of a bus, in this way you can draw the shape of the route. Then with this images you can train a CNN to classify the routes.

In this notebook we trained 2 neural networks, one using transfer learning over a ResNet50 pretrained network and  other using a 5 layers Neural Network built from scratch. Those 2 networks performed really well, see the notebook to check the results
